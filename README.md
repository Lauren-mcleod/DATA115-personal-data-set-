**Shark Attack Data**

**Motivation**
  
  My motivation for investigating shark attack data was to dive deepeer into the location and activities performed when people are attacked by sharks. Sharks play a vital role in the ocean and re  I found this topic interesting and had potential for a variety of research questions. I narrowed down my focus to the activity shark attack victims were doing when attacked.
  
 **Data Process**
 
 The raw data came from the [Global Shark Attack File](http://www.sharkattackfile.net/incidentlog.htm) with an excel file giving the details of each attack reported. This includes the location, activity, type of shark and the injuries from the attack. When processing the data I discovered there isn't a true definition of an attack. The majority of my data cleaning was removing the data where people reported having their kayak being bumped by a shark swimming by or attacks that were post mortum.

This figure shows the activities shark attack victims across the globe were doing at the time they were attacked.
