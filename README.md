**Shark Attack Data**

**Motivation**
  
  My motivation for investigating shark attack data was to dive deepeer into the location and activities performed when people are attacked by sharks. Sharks play a vital role in the ocean and re  I found this topic interesting and had potential for a variety of research questions. I narrowed down my focus to the activity shark attack victims were doing when attacked.
  
 **Data sources**
 
 The raw data came from the [Global Shark Attack File](http://www.sharkattackfile.net/incidentlog.htm). The GSAF is an organization providing an excel document with the details of reported shark attacks. This includes the location, activity, type of shark, and the injuries from the attack. The raw data comes from the The Global Shark Attack File's field reporters spread all over the globe gathering data. Additionally, anyone can contact them reporting an attack, which the organization will investigate and add to their data. 
 
 **Processing Steps**
 
Since the data provided was already in a well organized excel file, all of my processing was removing data that did not directly relate to my main focus. Initially when processing the data I discovered there isn't a true definition of an attack. I decided for my project to define a shark attack as the victim having an injury. The majority of cleaning was removing the reports of kayaks being bumped by a shark swimming by or attacks that were post mortum. The next step in processing the data is I narrowed down the information provided about every attack. Since my project is mainly focused on activity,
